		    <p>The GSX Series is Suzuki's range of sport touring motorcycles powered by four-valve per cylinder four-stroke engines. The first GSX models were introduced in 1980 and represented the next step in Suzuki's four-stroke road bike range after the two-valve GS Series. In North America though, the Suzuki four-valve and two-valve four-stroke road bikes were both designated as Suzuki GS motorcycles. The two-valve engines remained in production in parallel with the four-valve power plants, the larger two-valve four-cylinder engines gaining shaft-drive and being used to power Suzuki's more touring-orientated bikes such as the GS 850G and GS 1100G, while the GSX series represented performance orientation.</p>
