		    <p>In October of last year, Mercedes Benz began production of a new line of battery-powered trucks designed to enhance the safety and comfort of drivers and reduce the carbon footprint of municipal and long-distance towing vehicles. The electric truck by Mercedes is set to revolutionize the distribution industry.
                The first in this line of trucks is the eActros, a sleek hauler that is as comfortable as it is efficient. Unveiled in 2016 as a “truck ahead of its time,” the eActros is now in mainstream production overseas, with plans to introduce the truck to American markets sometime this year.
