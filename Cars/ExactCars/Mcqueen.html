		    <p>Cars is a 2006 American computer-animated sports comedy film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. The film was directed by John Lasseter from a screenplay by Dan Fogelman, Lasseter, Joe Ranft, Kiel Murray, Phil Lorin, and Jorgen Klubien and a story by Lasseter, Ranft, and Klubien, and was the final film independently produced by Pixar after its purchase by Disney in January 2006. Set in a world populated entirely by anthropomorphic talking cars and other vehicles, it follows on the racecar Lightning McQueen, who becomes lost after accidentally falling out of his trailer truck, Mack, in a run down town called Radiator Springs. As he finds himself sentenced to community service, only a miracle could get him back on track. McQueen must earn his way back to freedom and learn a thing or two about friendship, family, and the things in life that are truly worth waiting for.</p>
