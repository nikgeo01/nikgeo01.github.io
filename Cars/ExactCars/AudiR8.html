		    <p>As Audi's top model, the R8 sports car boasts a howling 602-hp V-10 engine just behind its snug two-seat cabin. It shares a lot with the Lamborghini Huracán, but the R8 is less flamboyantly styled. It's also less engaging to drive, but buyers seeking a super car that they can drive daily may find the Audi's refinement appealing. The interior is sparsely equipped, with all infotainment functions handled via the digital gauge cluster, but it's still a comfortable and upscale environment worthy of the R8's steep starting price. More cargo space would be appreciated, but that's not why you buy a car like this. You buy an R8—or its rivals, the Porsche 911 and McLaren 570S—for the fun that comes from driving it.</p>
